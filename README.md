# Pandemonium

# About

Work in progress game for Java final project. More coming soon...
As clearly seen in current form, the main setting of the game changed. At the beginning I imagined this project as a realistic shooter, but it soon transformed into a fantasy one. More fun for me that way and no big changes to the game mechanically really

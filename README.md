# Pandemonium

# About

Work in progress game for Java final project. More coming soon...
As clearly seen in current form, the main setting of the game changed. At the beginning I imagined this project as a realistic shooter, but it soon transformed into a fantasy one. More fun for me that way and no big changes to the game mechanically really

Planned features:
-

- `Difficulty slider`
- `Enemy types`
- `Shop`
- `Inventory`
- `Upgrades`
- `Bosses`
- `Procedurally generated maps` ✅ (kinda done ig)
- `Music and sounds` ✅ (partially)
- `Textures` ✅ (no animations yet, will work on that)
- `Main menu` ✅ (minor improvements to be done)
- `... and other`
